      <description>You might get amazed, finding out I managed to publish yet another book, where the previous one Efficiently Migrating your workloads to Azure only got published around Christmas.
However, this new one was a &amp;ldquo;longer work in progress&amp;rdquo;, and not something I could spew out in just a few weeks.
Several months ago, I got approached by Packt Publishing, asking me to &amp;ldquo;write a quick note on how I look at Azure strategic implementation and migration&amp;rdquo;.</description>

# Hi, my name is Peter De Tender.
### I am an **Azure Technical Trainer (ATT)** at **Microsoft**. Out of this role, I provide Azure readiness workshops to larger Microsoft customers and partners in EMEA, skilling up their Azure knowledge, and preparing them for Azure certification.

Before taking on this position, I was already an **Azure trainer and Azure Solution Architect** out of my own business, with a background in Microsoft datacenter consulting (Exchange, Forefront, System Center and Active Directory security as prime technologies, besides HP Servers and NetApp Storage :). Although I switched to the blue badge life, I will continue providing Azure readiness content here, as well as continue participating in user group events and presenting at different global conferences, in person or virtual.


I am a **[Microsoft Certified Trainer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mct-certification.aspx)** since 2010 (officially, but trained already before).


I was recognized as a **[Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/)** since 2013, initially in Windows IT Pro, but switched to Azure from 2015-2019.


Since 2011, I am the chairman for EMEA of the **[IAMCT (International Association of Microsoft Certified Trainers)](http://www.iamct.org)**, a global community of MCT's, outside of Microsoft Learning.

I'm married for +22 years with my loving wife Els, and am the proud father of 2 wonderful girls, Kaylee, 20y, studying Law in the USA, and Kitana, 15y, hoping to go study in South Korea soon. Our family recently expanded, since we adopted a 5 month old kitten, named Spot.
